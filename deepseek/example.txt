我睁着那双迷茫的小眼睛怔怔地看着前方，前方曲折陡峭，我说：“不敢前行。”您蹲下身子说：“孩子别怕，前方的路尽管坎坷，但爸爸会一直在您身后，做那个为你提灯的人。”我似懂非懂地点点头。你牵着我的手一步步迈过障碍。风景不应止步于此刻而应久留历史，绘画的梦如雨后春笋破土而出。I stared blankly ahead with my confused little eyes, which were twisted and steep, and I said, "I dare not move forward." You crouched down and said, "Don't be afraid, child, although the road ahead is bumpy, Dad will always be behind you and be the one who holds the lamp for you." I nodded incomprehensibly. You took my hand and stepped through the obstacles step by step. The scenery should not stop at this moment, but should be left in history for a long time, and the dream of painting sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain.
